/* ### A. Make a user object

1. Create an object called `user`.
2. Write in to the object the key-value pairs for `name`, `email`, `age`, and `purchased`. Set the value of `purchased` to an empty array `[]`. Set the other values to whatever you would like.
 */

// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~


var user = {
name: 'raed',
email: 'email',
age: 3,
purchased: []
}
/* 
### B. Update the user

1. Our user has changed his or her email address. Without changing the original `user` object, update the `email` value to a new email address.
2. Our user has had a birthday! Without changing the original `user` object, increment the `age` value using the postfix operator. Hint: `age++`
*/

// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
user.email = "new email address" ; 
user.age++ ;

/* ### C. Adding keys and values

You have decided to add your user's location to the data that you want to collect.

1. Without changing the original `user` object, add a new key `location` to the object, and give it a value or some-or-other location (a string).
*/

// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
user.location = 'Riyadh';

/* 
### D. Shopaholic!

1. Our user has purchased an item! They have purchased some "carbohydrates". Using `.push()`, add the string "carbohydrates" to the `purchased` array.
2. Our user has purchased an item! They have purchased some "peace of mind". Using `.push()`, add the string "peace of mind" to the `purchased` array.
3. Our user has purchased an item! They have purchased some "Merino jodhpurs". Using `.push()`, add the string "Merino jodhpurs" to the `purchased` array.
4. Console.log just the "Merino jodhpurs" from the `purchased` array.
*/
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

user.purchased.push('carbohydrates');
user.purchased.push('peace of mind');
user.purchased.push('Merino jodhpurs');

console.log(user.purchased[2]);

/* 
### E. Object-within-object

Remember that you can add an object to an existing object in the same way that you can add any new property/value pair.

If we want to give our user a `friend` with a `name` and `age`, we could write:

```javascript
user.friend = {
    name: "Grace Hopper",
    age: 85
}
``` 

When we console.log `user`, we would see the `friend` object added to our user object.
*/


/* 1. Write a `friend` object into your `user` object and give the friend a name, age, location, and purchased array (empty for now) */
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

user.friend = {
  name: "Grace Hopper",
  age: 85,
  location: 'Dammam',
  purchased: [],
}

/* 2. Console.log just the friend's name */
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

console.log(user.friend.name);

/* 3. Console.log just the friend's location */
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

console.log(user.friend.location);

/* 4. CHANGE the friend's age to 55 */
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

user.friend.age = 55 ;

/* 5. The `friend` has purchased "The One Ring". Use `.push()` to add "The One Ring" to the friend's `purchased` array. */
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

user.friend.purchased.push('The One Ring');



/* 6. The `friend` has purchased "A latte". Use `.push()` to add "A latte" to the friend's `purchased` array. */
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
user.friend.purchased.push('A latte');


/* 7. Console.log just "A latte" from the friend's `purchased` array. */
// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~


console.log(user.friend.purchased[1]);


/* ### F. Loops */

/* 1. Write a _for loop_ that iterates over the User's `purchased` array (NOT the friend's purchased array), and prints each element to the console. */

// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

for ( var i = 0 ; i < user.purchased.length ; i++){
  console.log(user.purchased[i]);
}

/* 2. Write a _for loop_ that iterates over the Friend's `purchased` array, and prints each element to the console. */

// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

for ( var i = 0 ; i < user.friend.purchased.length ; i++){
  console.log(user.friend.purchased[i]);
}



/* ### G. Functions can operate on objects */
/* 1. Write a single function `updateUser` that takes no parameters. When the function is run, it should:

  - it should increment the user's age by 1
  - make the user's name uppercase

  The function does not need a `return` statement, it will merely modify the user object. */

// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

function updateUser(){
  user.age++ ;
  user.name = user.name.toUpperCase();

}
// updateUser();
// console.log(user.name);

/* 2. Write a function `oldAndLoud` that performs the exact same tasks as `updateUser`, but instead of hard-coding it to only work on our `user` object, 
make it take a parameter `person`, and have it modify the object that is passed in as an argument when the function is called. Call your `oldAndLoud` 
function with `user` as the argument. */

// ~~~~~~~ your solution here: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
function oldAndLoud(person){
  person.age++ ;
  person.name = person.name.toUpperCase();

}
oldAndLoud(user);
console.log(user.name);
console.log(user.age);
